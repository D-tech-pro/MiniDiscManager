Only true heroes will make it through this quest alive!).\nFans of Nintendo's acclaimed series can play both of these games on their GameCubes, and enjoy a few technical improvements over the N64 versions, namely a higher 640x480 resolution, Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound support, and 480p Progressive Scan support. Veterans and newcomers alike will find something to enjoy with this excellent port of the classic N64 game.",

Warriors carrying a deck of the sought-after cards can then bring unprecedented amounts of destructive weapons and creatures into battle. Fight with the Hero Hunters or on the rebels' Dark Side and stack your decks accordingly. You'll compose several powerful decks from nearly 500 cards featuring fighting moves, weapons, and PSO creatures.",

The battle of mankind and gods is about to begin.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game mechanisms are generally carried over from the original Shikigami No Shiro, with the addition of more playable characters.\n\nThe game consists of five stages, each with two parts, with a boss at the end of each part. At the end of each stage, dialogue between the player character(s) and the bosses are shown in cut scenes; a unique sequence of dialogue is shown for every different character or combination of two characters.\n\nEach character has a primary weapon, used by tapping or holding one firing button; holding the button for more than a few seconds, however, will switch to the character's secondary \"Shikigami\" weapon. This tends to be more powerful, but limited in range or utility, and also slows character movement. Each character's weapons are different, sometimes dramatically, in terms of pattern and power; in addition, each Shikigami weapon is available in one of two modes, chosen at the start of each new game. Bombs are also available, and each character's bombs function differently as well.\n\nThe leveling up of weapons from the original game is the only mechanic eliminated in the sequel.\n\nTension Bonus System\n\nAs with many shooters, the game places emphasis on obtaining high scores, which is facilitated by the Tension Bonus System (TBS). The TBS causes a player's score received to multiply, by factors of up to eight times, based on the player character's proximity to enemy bullets or enemies themselves; this is characteristic of the \"grazing\" mechanics found in games of the bullet hell genre. By staying close to hazardous objects, multipliers can be maintained for extended periods of time. In addition, destroyed enemies release coins that give extra points, which are also affected by the multiplier.\n\nThe player's weapons also play a part in the TBS; when the multiplier is at maximum, the primary weapon increases in power and range for as long as this is maintained. In addition, coins released by enemies destroyed with the Shikigami weapon are automatically collected.\n Options\n\nFive difficulty levels are available, for both the regular game and the \"extreme mode\", in which enemies release additional fire when destroyed.\n\nAn alternate soundtrack, \"S2MIX\", is also available. The original soundtrack has been completely replaced in the European PS2 release.",

Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.",

Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President's daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo's next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.",

The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and being raised by dragonflies. He has no idea that he‚Äôs a dragon, but once Spyro discovers this, he will have access to many of his dragon talents, including fire breathing and flying. He will need all of these abilities to take down the evil black dragon Cinder, who is plotting to resurrect an evil force and take over the world. A New Beginning focuses more on battle than platforming. Spyro‚Äôs breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts, Spyro also has access to one fury move per element. These moves damage enemies across the entire screen. The flying levels work just like aerial shooters, with Spyro blasting his way through Cinder‚Äôs flying forces while dodging and spiraling out of the way of incoming blasts. These break up the combat missions and, together, turn THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING into a great game that explores Spyro‚Äôs past and turns him into the dragon hero everyone loves.",

Instead, the game presents players with a unique style of graphics and character design, fun shooter controls, and a good amount of humor. Players take on the role of a field officer in Battalion Wars. As an officer in the Western Frontier army, players find themselves battling the forces of the Tundran Empire at first, but the Empire and the Frontier quickly find themselves signing a peace treaty and uniting against the Xylvanians, a third faction that attacks both groups after they are weakened. Players then take direct control of their squad and head to the battlefield. One of the interesting aspects of Battalion Wars is that players aren‚Äôt represented by any one character. Instead, they can take control of any unit on the battlefield. This allows gamers to jump around during the battle, controlling an infantryman for a few minutes, then switching to a vehicle to perform a quick assault, then taking control of a heavily armed solider to take down a bunker. The other units, of course, continue their attacks even when the player isn‚Äôt controlling them, creating an interesting system of battle. Battalion Wars combines strategy with a third person shooter in such a way that players will enjoy. With the ability to command many different units in the same battle and plan strategies involving different units, Battalion Wars is a great humorous war game for all players.",

Bunting is more unique, though. Instead of aiming the cursor when you go to bunt, a large arrow points on the ground. Aim your bunt in the desired direction and hope for the best. Fielding has also received a slight change, with the ball cursor changing color. Four up to four players.",

Experience the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters, and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive game.",

A third-person perspective shooter game, Sarge's War is an easy game to pick up but a difficult one to master. The levels get progressively harder, with Sarge facing waves of enemies at a time. Fortunately, the game has a target lock feature, so Sarge can pick off his enemies one at a time. Some levels require Sarge to destroy walls, fences, or enemy artillery, and in other levels, he takes command of turret gun to wreak some major damage. In addition to the single-player campaign, ARMY MEN: Sarge's War contains several multiplayer modes, including death match, capture the flag, and team advance. Fans of the ARMY MEN series will be glad to see it continued with ARMY MEN: Sarge's War. Players who have fond memories of waging war with the little plastic army men or enjoy third-person shooters will also find Sarge's War a fun, entertaining game to pick up.",

It features a level-based, third-person-shooter style of design, but also includes a rich story line and a healthy dose of adventure game-type puzzles. Skye, our heroine, fights and puzzles her way through 30 real-time levels. Gameplay within each level is open-ended, free-roaming and non-linear. Magic takes the place of high-tech weaponry in the frequent combat encounters, while cutting-edge humor replaces blood and gore. The game is rendered in beautiful, high fantasy style and the quest is serious but Skye and her companion, a mouthy little gargoyle named Draak, make a steady stream of irreverent observations that poke fun at gaming cliches, themselves and their hopeless quest.",

Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On the first level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are eight different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters' shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.",

        "description": "Enhanced port of the Dreamcast RPG, offering a mix of real-time exploration and turn-based battle sequences. Like the RPGs of old, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, the basic idea is to send a player out into the world to slay groups of enemies, gain experience, buy weapons and items, and accomplish something grand. As lead character Vyse and his trusty female sidekick, Aika, you dock one of the evil Valuan's ships to take it over and grab some loot. As members of the Blue Rogues -- pirates that in Robin Hood fashion give to the poor and steal from the corrupted rich -- it's your whole life. In the process, you stumble into more than you bargained for. The actual gameplay itself revolves around several different devices: turn-based ground and air battles, airship-to-airship duels, and real-time 3D exploration.",

Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes. Voice-over commentary for the 06 version is provided by Clive Tydsley and Andy Gray. Soccer fans will enjoy hearing their expert commentary throughout the season as they recruit, train, and guide a soccer club to victory in FIFA SOCCER 06.",

Previously released on Famicom (Japan-only), Super Famicom (Japan-only), and Game Boy Advance, Fire Emblem leaves the 2D overhead maps of old behind to serve up 3D villages, fields, and caves, and polygonal battle sequences. The continent of Tellius is divided into humans and half-man/half-beast demi-humans. These two races have battled for centuries and only recently established an uneasy peace. Now, a new force threatens to tear apart the seven kingdoms and reignite the flames of war. Joining the Fire Emblem ranks are new units, such as such as the shape-shifting laguz who transform into beasts to attack their foes. Additionally, characters can now learn unique skills as they gain experience, giving players even more ways to customize their strategy.",

The reality you know must end in order to save it.\n\nAt an indeterminable point in mankind's future, ordered society has reverted to a feudal state, scattered groups of survivors huddling together in small villages and nomadic enclaves. Mankind is running scared of the greatest to it's existence since reality first sputtered into existence.\n\nDecades ago, the face of the planet changed, entire cities disappeared overnight, whole countries vanished. Left in their place were creatures, hideous shambling monstrosities, technologically advance, and yet intellectually retarded. And as mankind would soon discover, this was an enemy that could not be stopped and killed.

The game features a day and night system, where days last about 10 minutes and nights the same. The environments slightly change depending on the time of day. For instance, a character not available in the day might be sleeping on the couch at night, and robots normally roaming the level in the afternoon might be gone in the evening.",

The game ships on two discs, one designed as a standalone single-player quest, the other containing a unique online version of the title. Taking a cue from the setup of the classic pen-and-paper RPG Dungeons & Dragons, the online portion of Homeland has one player act as the dungeon master game leader. Instead of directly participating in the adventure, this player controls the game universe, spawns monsters, views player stats, and set up events. Instead of having players connecting to a dedicated game server or online service, the dungeon master's GameCube acts as the server, allowing up to 30 players to connect and participate in the game. Released by mail-order in April, Homeland saw wider retail release in Japan on June 30, 2005.",

Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or start a fast break; and dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, spin and much more. It?s all happening in NBA 2K3. No other game delivers the physical element of basketball like this. Accurate impact from collisions, especially hard fouls and authoritative dunks; shot blocking with emphasis on precise hand-to-ball contact; and the ability to lunge for the loose ball, even if it means ending up on some celebrity?s lap. With commentators that analyze strategy, cutscenes portraying lifelike player interaction, uniforms that move like real fabric, and a brand new ESPN broadcast system that wraps it all together, NBA 2K3 provides the complete NBA experience.",

Drain treys from deep beyond the arc or bang around down low and dominate the post with your inside game. With \"off-the-backboard\" no-look passes and dizzying crossover dribbles your opponent will be beggin' for mercy as you pump up your power meter. Stop...Pop...Drop -- Count it, baby! If your game's weak, you don't have to go home, but you've gotta get off the court. It's not basketball. It's streetball. You got game?",

        "description": "The third battle game based on the Shonen Jump manga and \"One Piece\" anime show. Starring the majority of the cast from the television series, One Piece Grand Battle! 3 is a fast-paced action game in the vein of Power Stone. The game features a much wider variety of surfaces than its predecessors, including sand, water, and snow. The developers also created a new combo system that enables each character to pull off weak, medium, and high power combos that vary in speed and effectiveness depending on when they are used in battle. Featuring around 50 characters, plenty of special attacks, and 100 different battle events, Grand Battle lets players go it alone or team up with a friend.",

The new additions in Mario Party 6 include day and night cycles, new characters and mini-games, and of course, the new microphone. Two of the new characters, named Brighton (a sun) and Twila (a crescent moon) get into a heated debate over who's better. The dispute creates a day/night dichotomy that comes into play whenever playing on any of the six game boards. When you're ready to play, a pop-up book springs open and highlights your options. Party Mode is where you'll find the different board games, which you can play solo or with friends. Instead of just collecting stars, though, each board features different objectives. Mario Party 6 features over 80 different mini-games.",

Eventually, you'll meet up with a loopy new sidekick named Prince Tricky, learn how to ride on the backs of dinosaurs, fight enemies in hand-to-hand combat, and much more.

During the fights, energy crystals will be saved up for each successful attack. These activate cinematic special attacks unique to the character, depending on the number of crystals gained.(Max.3) Full voice acting is also featured during Story Mode, directly from the Japanese version anime. Story Mode is played out asYoh Asakura through the anime's story line. Shaman Fight Mode is a free-play fight option, Shaman King Mode is a survival mode option where you choose three characters out of eight to fight through 4 random battles, and level them up for play in one of the Shaman Fight modes. The 4th battle is always Hao Asakura in this mode.",

As usual, players will be traveling the world looking for the biggest and most dangerous game, which includes wolves, cougars, bears, and even polar bears. This time, the game takes players through Australia, Africa, Alaska, and even to the frozen tundra of Siberia as they stalk the most wanted game. Players will have several options when it comes to choosing guns, bullets, and other accessories. Animal calls, traps, decoys, and bait are all available for sell and use in the wild. As players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds, however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting games are always great, and CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 is no exception. Gamers looking for the next big challenge in virtual hunting won't be disappointed.",

In the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere. While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches. Developed by Treasure, the game takes the form of a fixed-perspective 3D brawler/platform game, with combo-based attacks and lots of creatures to beat up.",

During the simulation parts, you move units around on a gridded map in an attempt to increase your territory. When your unit ends up on in the same spot as an enemy, you enter into battle with full control over your Battle Suit in fast-paced action in one of two viewpoints (2D overhead or 3D direct view).\n\nThe single player story mode has you follow a series of scenarios as you work through battles. Multiplayer mode has support for up to four players, although you can go up directly against three computer opponents if you like. In multiplayer mode, you and your opponents set up an original team prior to battle.",

Played from a top-down overhead view, players take control of Prince Gilgamesh on his quest to rescue his love, Ki, from the vicious Druaga. Using his sword and shield to attack and defend, Gilgamesh faces off with plenty of monsters, including everyone's favorite slimes, and tracks down hidden chests for items and keys. As he climbs the tower floor by floor, players have to employ the use of special items to solve puzzles and overcome Druaga's minions, such as potions, jet boots, and a pick ax.",
